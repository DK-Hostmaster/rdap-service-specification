# The .dk Registry in Brief

DK Hostmaster is the registry for the ccTLD for Denmark (dk). The current model used in Denmark is based on a sole registry, with DK Hostmaster maintaining the central DNS registry.

<a name="features"></a>
# Features

The RDAP service offers the following features.

- Domain name inquiry
- Nameserver inquiry
- Entity inquiry
- Support for multiple encodings (see: [Encoding](#encoding) below)
- Support for both IPv6 and IPv6

<a name="implementation-limitations"></a>
# Implementation Limitations

<a name="localization"></a>
## Localization

In general the service is not localized and all information is provided in English, address data however represented in a format suitable for use in the DK Hostmaster registry, meaning addresses in Denmark are represented in the local format and addresses based outside Denmark in the international representation if available.

For more information on this please refer to the section on contact creation in the [EPP service specification](https://github.com/DK-Hostmaster/epp-service-specification#create-contact).

<a name="media-type--format"></a>
## Media-type / Format

The service supports the following media-types: 

- `application/json` for JSON
- `application/rdap+json` also for JSON

<a name="encoding"></a>
## Encoding

The service supports the following encodings:

- UTF-8, being the primary encoding used
- Punycode [RFC:3492][RFC:3492], please see the specific APIs for information on use of this encoding. This is solely used representing IDN domain names and nameserver names under IDN domain names
- URI encoding [RFC:3986][RFC:3986], this is not a part of the RDAP standard, but it is supported for transparency and client support

<a name="rate-limiting"></a>
## Rate Limiting

Currently no rate limiting is implemented

We reserve the right to adjust the rate limit in order ensure quality of service. 

<a name="security"></a>
## Security

The service is only available under **TLS 1.2**

<a name="authentication"></a>
## Authentication

Authentication is currently unsupported and hereby authorization, so only public available data are presented.

<a name="non-supported-apis"></a>
## Non-supported APIs

The following RDAP capabilities are unsupported by DK Hostmaster.

- AS query
- IP query
- Domain search
- Entity search
- Nameserver search

<a name="service"></a>
# Service

The service is available at:

- `https://rdap.dk-hostmaster.dk`

The service offers four APIs, one specialized for each entity type:

- domain (domainname)
- nameserver (hostname/nameserver)
- entity (userid)
- help

The service requires that the `Accept` header is specified to be `application/json` or `application/rdap+json`, all of the below examples demonstrates this using the commandline utilities `curl` or `httpie`.

If the header is unspecified, not specified correctly or specified to an unsupported format, the service will error with HTTP status code: `415`

```bash
$ curl https://rdap.dk-hostmaster.dk/entity/DKHM1-DK 
"Unsupported Media Type"
```

Correct specification using `curl` should be as follows:

```bash
> curl --header "Accept: application/json" https://rdap.dk-hostmaster.dk/entity/DKHM1-DK
```

And for `httpie`:

```bash
$ http https://rdap.dk-hostmaster.dk/handle/DKHM1-DK Accept:'application/json'
```

<a name="domain"></a>
## domain

This service returns data on a given domain name.

<a name="api"></a>
### API

    https://rdap.dk-hostmaster.dk/domain/{domainname}

The service returns `200` if the relevant object is available.

| Return Code  | Description |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| `200` | OK |
| `400` | Bad request |
| `404` | Object not found |
| `415` | Unsupported media type |

<a name="example"></a>
### Example

Using `httpie`

```bash
$ http https://rdap.dk-hostmaster.dk/domain/eksempel.dk Accept:'application/json'
```

Using `curl` and `jq`

```bash
$ curl --header "Accept: application/json" https://rdap.dk-hostmaster.dk/domain/eksempel.dk | jq
```
